title:: The Keywords: let & var
alias:: let, var, let and var, let & var

- `let`
	- `let` was introduced in _ECMAScript 6_, and it supported by **TypeScript**.
	- `let` is recommended over the use of `var`.
	- Declarations with `let` are not hoisted and support the block scope.
		- Therefore, the `let` keyword is better for scoping of _variables_ in a _function_.
