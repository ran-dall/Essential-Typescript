- Optional static typing, or **Optionally Typed Language**
	- This allows you to declare variables and not specify their types.
	- TypeScript can do _type inference_.
- Supports the latest and evolving [[JavaScript]] features.
	- ...and even _future_ futures.
- TypeScript is more productive than [[JavaScript]].
	- Especially, if you have prior experience in **Typed Languages**.
- Supports _classes_, _interfaces_, _generics_, _annotations_, _public_/_private_/_protected_ _access_ and **_more_**.
## Benefits of Static Types
- You can get help from the IDE tooling, which is very helpful in TypeScript.
- If you want to refactor your code, it's easier to do with TypeScript.
