- The use of [Static Typing](((61b4e176-494a-4574-944b-d4af1a5369a0))) is optional (which makes it an **Optionally Typed Language**).
	- This allows you to declare variables and not specify their types.
	- TypeScript can do _type inference_.

- Supports _classes_, _interfaces_, _generics_, _annotations_, _public_/_private_/_protected_ _access_ and **_more_**.
